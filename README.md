### 1.5 POINTS
### KEY: Mostly correct, however you didn't set the 'required' attribute for the terms checkbox

# HTML Input 2 CW

Duplicate the form depicted in the included image. Note the following:

* Use placeholders where shown
* Make First and Last name required, as well as checkbox for agreeing to the terms
* Use the proper 'type' field for ```email```, ```password```, and ```birthday```
* Style as close to the example as you can but feel free to add additional styling (as it is quite the boring form...)
